        <p>It has been a while since you last did anything on this website,
            and the server has forgotten what you were doing at the time. 
            You will need to go back to the 
            <h:link outcome="/rich/upload">main page</h:link> to continue.</p>
        
        <p>If you were using the limited-functionality uploader and had added
            files but not yet pressed the "finished" button, your files should have
            been sent. It would still be a good idea to confirm with the intended 
            recipient that they got them.</p>
