        <h1>Session Expired</h1>
        <p>It has been a while since you last did anything on this website,
            and the server has forgotten what you were doing at the time.
            You will need to go back to the main page to continue.</p>
        
        <p>If you were using the limited-functionality uploader and had added
            files but not yet pressed the "finished" button, your files should have
            been sent. It would still be a good idea to confirm with the intended 
            recipient that they got them.</p>
