- Provide a configuration mechanism for setting the final file output path
  in a reasonable way. This may be done via application properties, or 
  via a new configuration page.

- Provide non-container-managed JavaMail so we can deploy more easily in
  Tomcat or a Web Profile server. This depends on some kind of configuration
  mechanism.

- Collect upload history in a JPA database, provide UI for viewing uploads.

- Optionally authenticate senders using OAuth or OpenID, pre-fill sender
  details if authenticated user detected. "Remember me" option.

- Add captcha for unauthenticated senders to help slow bots down a bit.

- Refuse to send confirmation messages to unverified sender address to
  help prevent spam, or only do so with a captcha.

- Write some less ugly CSS

- Add user hints to help with multiple file uploads. Users won't understand
  that they can multi-select in a file open dialog, and will painstakingly
  add each file by hand.
