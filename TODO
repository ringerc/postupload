- On failed uploads in rich mode, where summary submit fails, redirect
  to error page.

- Collect upload history in a JPA database, provide UI for viewing uploads.

- Optionally authenticate senders using OAuth or OpenID, pre-fill sender
  details if authenticated user detected. Alternately, use ReCaptcha if
  user checks "want receipt".

- Add user hints to help with multiple file uploads. Users won't understand
  that they can multi-select in a file open dialog, and will painstakingly
  add each file by hand.

- Write some less ugly CSS
