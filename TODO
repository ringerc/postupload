- Collect upload history in a JPA database, provide UI for viewing uploads.

- Optionally authenticate senders using OAuth or OpenID, pre-fill sender
  details if authenticated user detected. "Remember me" option.

- Add captcha for unauthenticated senders to help slow bots down a bit.

- Add user hints to help with multiple file uploads. Users won't understand
  that they can multi-select in a file open dialog, and will painstakingly
  add each file by hand.

- Write some less ugly CSS
